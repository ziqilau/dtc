# nDTCM

## Features
  nDTCM is used to organize the data in social streams. We believe the meaningful semantic features discovered by nDTCM can    also benefit the representation of social streams.  
  Using nDTCM as a building block can further analyze sophisticated structures/patterns in social streams.

## Data
  Each data point is represented as one line in plain format, splited by space, accordingly denoted as EPOCH #PARTICIPANTS   PARTICIPANTS(split by commas) #DISTINCT_WORDS WORD:FREQUENCY
  15 5 0,1,2,3,4, 18 14:1 43:1 45:1 31:1 40:1 49:1 6:2 7:2 33:1 34:2 22:1 2:1 8:1 32:1 26:1 27:2 53:1 23:1
